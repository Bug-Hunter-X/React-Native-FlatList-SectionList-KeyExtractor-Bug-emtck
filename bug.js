In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error arises when the keyExtractor prop isn't correctly implemented or is missing. If the keys aren't unique, updates to the list won't reflect properly, leading to inconsistent rendering or seemingly random behavior. This can manifest as items not updating, disappearing, or appearing in the wrong order even when the data source changes.
